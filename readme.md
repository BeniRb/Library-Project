Library project

This website is a virtual library.
The website lets you manage basic library functions: handeling customers, books and
keeping check on the books loaned from the library.



-To manage the website properly please take a look at the following guidlines:

-When you add a customer or a book the the library adds the ID manually.

-When adding a book to the library database you will have to determine the book type:

type 1- Book can be loaned for 10 days
type 2-Book can be loaned for 5 days
type 3- Book can be loaned for 2 days

You choose the type of the book when you add it to the library.

if a book is loaned for more days than the book type "allows" it, the book will be considered late.

Loans:
every book has a status: "avaialable" and "not available"
when the book is available you can loan it or do changes to it.
when it isnt available the program won't let you loan this book untill the previous loan is retruned.
